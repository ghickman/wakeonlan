WakeOnLan
=========

A simple script to send 'magic packets' to another computer to turn it on remotely.

Usage:

Run on the command line like so:

python wakeonlan.py -i <ip-address> -m <remote-mac-address>

where <ip-address> is the IP address you wish to send the packets to and
<remote-mac-address> is the MAC address of the remote computer.

The script runs on port 80 by default.
